Python Practice Programs
<br>
This repository contains basic Python programs created as part of my programming practice. The focus of these tasks is to learn how to take user input, use conditions, work with loops, and perform simple calculations.

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
<br>
In this task, I wrote a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using an if-else statement. If the number is divisible by 2, the program displays that it is even, otherwise it displays that it is odd. This task helped me understand how to handle user input, perform arithmetic operations with the modulus operator, and use conditional statements in Python.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
<br>
In this task, I created a program to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 50. I used a for loop to iterate through numbers in the given range and maintained a running total using a variable. After the loop completed, the program displayed the final sum (1275). I also explored alternative methods, such as using Pythonâ€™s built-in sum() function and applying the mathematical formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. This task helped me practice loops, arithmetic operations, and different approaches to solving a problem.
