'''Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

         Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
                  1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
                  2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
                  3.   Displays the final sum.
'''

#Solution  1 :
a = 0
for  i in range(1,51):
    #solution 2
    a = a+i

# Solution 3
print("The sum of number from 1 to 50 is ", a)
